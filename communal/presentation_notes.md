# Presentation Planning
## Specification
Prepare a 10-12 minute presentation to include the following topics.

‚ùó You are unlikely to have time to include all the recommended details in the presentation but be prepared to take further questions on these topics.

1. Solution Research & Planning
2. Planning & Delivery
3. MVP Demonstration
4. Tools & Technologies
5. Significant Wins
6. Challenges and Solutions
7. Future Features

### Q&A
Immediately after your presentation, there will be a 5-10 minute Q&A facilitated by the event host (a La Fosse Academy staff member).

During this Q&A aim to give space for each person on your team to speak.
You may like to prepare an appendix to your presentation deck to reference as appropriate during Q&A.
See our Presentation Guide for tips

## What should be covered 

### Problem to be solved + Approach
    - Phone theft in London

### Planning
    - use of api-contracts to reduce friction across the stack
    - clearly defined db schema and erd
    - requirements formally defined for the MVP

### High-level architechture / stack
    - Use of PostGIS
    - Use of .NET
    - Use of React/React-native/typescript

### Backend architechture
    - layered 
    - centralised auth
    - ef core mounted database
    - use of Dtos and models
    - dependency injection
    - request-response flow

### Web frontend 
    - React

## Specification
Prepare a 10-12 minute presentation covering:

1. **Solution Research & Planning**
2. **Planning & Delivery**
3. **MVP Demonstration**
4. **Tools & Technologies**
5. **Significant Wins**
6. **Challenges and Solutions**
7. **Future Features**

*Q&A (5-10 min) follows. Prepare an appendix for reference and ensure all team members participate.*

---

## 1. Problem to be Solved + Approach
- **Challenge:** Phone theft in London.
- **Approach:** User-centric, cross-platform app for reporting, viewing, and analyzing incidents.

---

## 2. Planning
- **API Contracts:** Defined early to enable parallel development and reduce integration bugs.
- **Documentation:** Consistent docs (`architecture.md`, `db_schema.md`, `requirements.md`) for onboarding and clarity.
- **Requirements:** MVP features and data flows formally specified.

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture / Stack
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core, EF Core, PostGIS (geospatial queries).
- **Frontend:** React (web), React Native (mobile), TypeScript.
- **Testing:** NUnit, Moq, in-memory database for fast, reliable tests.

---

## 4. Backend Architecture
- **Layered Structure:** Controllers, repositories, domain models for maintainability.
- **Centralized Auth:** JWT tokens for secure access.
- **Dependency Injection:** For testability and loose coupling.
- **DTOs:** Standardized data flow between layers and platforms.
- **Request-Response Flow:** Clear separation of concerns.

---

## 5. Web Frontend
- **React:** Modular component structure.
- **API Integration:** Consumes backend endpoints via contracts.

---

## 6. Mobile Frontend
- **React Native:** Opens directly to map of Greater London.
- **Navigation:** Bottom tab bar for easy page switching.
- **Map Features:** Long-press to report, tap markers for details.

---

## 7. Data
- **Visualizations:** Crime data analytics and mapping.
- **Future:** Predictive mapping, deeper insights.

---

## Significant Wins
- **Layered Architecture:** Easier maintenance and scaling.
- **Reusable DTOs:** Consistency across web, mobile, and backend.
- **Automated Testing:** Full suite for backend reliability.

---

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Geospatial Data:** NetTopologySuite + PostGIS integration.
- **Mobile Navigation:** Tab navigation for better UX.
- **Validation:** Custom property setters enforce business rules.

---

## Future Features
- **Push Notifications:** Real-time alerts for nearby thefts.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Predictive crime mapping.
- **Community Features:** Comments, upvotes, moderation.
- **Admin Dashboard:** For law enforcement/city officials.

---

## Q&A Preparation
- **Appendix:** Architecture diagrams, API contracts, test coverage.
- **Team Roles:** Highlight contributions in planning, coding, testing, and design.
